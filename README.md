# Benchmarking-in-Go
A collection of interesting benchmarks to help you become a better Go developer overall.

## To Do
- [ ] Everytime the repository is updated, a worker processo should initiate that re-runs all the necessary benchmarks.
- [ ] Should have a website for the repository that make's an API request to a database that hold's the current benchmarks.
